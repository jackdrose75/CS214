/*
Server
The server will open a port and wait for connection requests. 
On connection, it will spawn a service thread to handle that 
connection and go back to waiting for requests. Each service 
thread should read in a client request, if it is a sort request, 
it should perform the sort and store the results at the server. 

If it is a dump request, it should merge the current collection 
of sorted results into one sorted list and send the result back 
to the client. 

You may want/need to make use of synchronization constructs like 
mutex_locks, semaphores, and/or condition variables in your 
implementation to prevent memory corruption.
 
The server will run until stopped by a SIGKILL (i.e. kill <pid of server>).
 
To STDOUT, output a list of the ip addresses of all the clients that have connected: (?-> when?)
Received connections from: <ipaddress>,<ipaddress>,<ipaddress>,â€¦
