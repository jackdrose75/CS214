Discussed problems with project0 that will occur in assimgent1.
Read through assignment1 and planned out steps required to implement code.

1) Search through current directory to find all CSV files/subdirectories.
2) Spawn sorter.c from assignment 0, fork children of sorter into subdirectories.
3) Print the PID, PPID, and counter of total processes.
   Output the new sorted CSV files.


10.24.2017 - 
created a testscanner.c that goes into current directory and locates all .csv files.
needs to be done: implement a recursive function along with finding subdirectories.
